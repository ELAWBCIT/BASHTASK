#### Additional Supplementary Links
- The listed are files I had used to assist my understanding of the bash scripting assignment. Some items are things used out of class content whilst others are class content supplements. 

1) -z string flag
True if the length of the string is zero
https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Conditional-Constructs

2) random number generator between a range
Ex: $ shuf -i $min-$max -n 1
-i option of shuf specifies the input range
-n option specifies number of random numbers generated by shuf (in this case it is 1)

3) writing to a file 
echo "data for file" >> outputfile

4) grep -n 
grep -n "${service}" passlog.txt

deleting exact string patterns
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/206903/match-exact-string-using-grep

5) delete by a line using sed
sed -i "/ID: ${ID}/d" tasklisting.txt
-i takes extension argument in case we want to save original file as backup
-compares the pattern within the quotes, regex pattern to look for ID

sudo su -l root 
sudo chown strike:strike /etc/personalpasswords
